# candycrushnfc
In this project, I developed a web-based interactive candy collection experience utilizing NFC (Near Field Communication) technology and advanced web development techniques. Users tap NFC tags that direct their browser to a URL, triggering JavaScript that checks and updates candy counts based on data stored in local storage. The frontend dynamically displays the collected candies, updating in real-time to provide immediate feedback and a visually engaging user experience.
